It’s really easy for adults to do this kind of thing unconsciously.  It’s easy to get caught up in the notion that “They’re in time out, and that’s the end of it!” but kids can be pretty imaginative, and they can use their own creativity to make their way out of time outs.  A compassionate time out ends when the child shows a sign of understanding what they’ve done wrong, and are ready to begin again.  That way the child knows they’re learning, and that the parent is seeing them as an intelligent person, even if they sometimes mess up.  You can still use the other techniques you were using to be tough when necessary, but using a compassionate approach will let you use them without actually using them!\n\nHuman",

The Illustrated Man is a collection of short stories.  One of my favorites is The Veldt, which depicts a post-apocalyptic future where young people are allowed to spend all their time playing in their “pleasure garden”, isolated from the outside world.  The Veldt is also a very sad book, because children are not equipped to deal with harsh reality without guidance.",

The Martian Chronicles is a collection of short stories that often begin with an ominous note of impending tragedy, for example “The Big Black and White Game”. There are also novellas like The Martian Chronicles or Fahrenheit 451. Fahrenheit 451 was an important work in that it gave expression to Bradbury’s concerns about the limitations of freedom and creativity in the modern world, and about the dangers of censorship.",

It’s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.  The day of rest was also being violated by stores that stayed open all day on Sunday, so closing stores on Sundays became an effort to protect the Sabbath for all citizens.",

      "content": "That is a common question I’m asked, and I think it has a tricky answer!  I think my answer is “yes” and “no.”  You may be thinking of “Time Dilation” or “Warp Drive”, but it’s not what I’m thinking of.   What I’m thinking of is the way that our imagination works.\n\nImagine you had a thin sheet of flexible plastic which could be pulled out from a roll to become a long tube, about 100m long.  We call this a “wormhole”, as in, it’s a flexible wormhole.  If you were floating in space, and grabbed one end of it and held it, then the other end would stretch to the ground, into the ground and back out again.  If you stood on the ground, you could then pull it and have it lift you up into the air.  The question is, could the Earth rotate under the “wormhole” while the person holding it was “in the air”?\n\nThe answer is, no.  The “wormhole” analogy is a bit strange, so let me explain it more carefully.\n\nI think when you are floating above the ground, you are also moving around it.  But in the same way that you can hold one end of the wormhole while floating, the Earth is also moving around you.  So you might wonder how it could “rotate” while you are also moving around it.\n\nThis is a situation of accelerating motion.  A spaceship, say, accelerates around the Earth so that it is moving at a speed which is near the speed of light.  As it flies past, we say it moves “faster than light” and we call this “tachyonic motion” or “tachyons” for short.  Tachyons are things that accelerate faster than light, and as they pass by, objects may seem to move or “rotate” as they pass, even though the objects themselves are not moving.\n\nI hope this answer has helped to clarify how we can still see the Earth rotating even if it is also accelerating in the other direction.  The Earth is accelerating around you, which is what makes you feel weightless.  This is why it’s called “Weightlessness”.",

But if you want to show your gratitude in the form of a gift, the last thing you want is to make the doctor feel obligated to reciprocate.  If you do want to give the doctor a gift, it should be something that’s meaningful to you personally and reflects your values and preferences.  Even if you did want to give the doctor a gift or some other appreciation, I wouldn’t suggest buying an expensive gift or restaurant meal to show your gratitude.",
